Flipper Zero notes repository and information. 

---- ----

Information that is associated to this repo are for notes and gotchas that I have run into, in the hopes to help other developers that are working with the Flipper Zero. This will be used to keep track of simple apps and development with the Flipper Zero Device and the notes I have for the version that I am working with.

Here is a list of projects that I am wanting to work towards while working on this device: 

- BadUSB
    - I want to utilize BadUSB for a more administrational aspect. This includes addressing instalation and updating programs through [Chocolatey][https://www.chocolatey.org]
    - Applications that I want to set up are the following: 
        - Install Chocolatey
        - Install through Chocolatey: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Visual Studio Code,
        - Uninstall through Chocolatey, if possible: All applications that are not needed. If this is not able to be done, then address it through the command line process to uninstall programs (list of tried and tested will follow.)
- NFC
    - Through the use of NFC, I want to address information that is going to be for building NFC commands and instructions and backing up these commands. This includes:
        - Wifi network connection through NFC Tags
        - Contact Card information passing
        - Tonie and Amiibo back process
        - Commands through NFC to run commands
        - How to set up NFC Tags
- Infrared
    - There are two things that the infrared will be used for, one will be for how to set up and work with TV remotes, but also with infrared sensors for parking and distance. These may be split up, one for the Flipper Zero and the other for the Raspberry Pi, but I would like to try and get the code to work with the Flipper Zero first using a breakout board. 
- SubgHz 
    - I am not sure what I am going to be using this one for, but time will tell.
- Wifi
    - I am wanting to use this as an analyzer to address signal strength and figure out how to get it work work on the Flipper. There may be more projects later.
